    "title": "Price of trade wars: Analysing Trump’s tariff policies",
    "text": "United States (US) President Donald Trump's administration has aggressively pursued a trade policy centered on tariffs, aiming to recalibrate economic relationships with key global players. This strategy, particularly focused on China, has led to significant disruptions in global trade, with repercussions felt across multiple sectors. The administration’s rationale for imposing tariffs has been to correct trade imbalances, protect American industries, and counteract what it perceives as unfair trade practices by foreign governments. However, the efficacy and broader implications of these measures remain contentious, with economists and policymakers debating whether the costs outweigh the benefits."
